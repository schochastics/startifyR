# startifyR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

startifyR is similar to [cowsay](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay), just with different quotes and ascii art.

## Installation

You can install the development version of startifyR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("schochastics/startifyR")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(startifyR)
startify()
```

```{r example2}
startify()
```

If you want to have a different quote everytime you start an R console, put
```r
startifyR::startify()
```

in `~/.Rprofile`.
